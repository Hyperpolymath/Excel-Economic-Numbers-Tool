## Becoming a Maintainer

We welcome new maintainers! The path to maintainership:

1. **Regular Contributions**: Demonstrate consistent, quality contributions
2. **Community Engagement**: Help others via issues, discussions, reviews
3. **Technical Expertise**: Show deep understanding of codebase
4. **Trust**: Build trust through reliability and judgment

6. **Consensus**: Current maintainers reach consensus

Typical timeline: 6-12 months of active contribution

### Expected Commitment

Maintainers typically commit:
- 4-8 hours per week
- Availability for urgent security issues
- Participation in monthly maintainer meetings
- Code review within 1 week

## Emeritus Maintainers

Maintainers who have stepped down but retain advisory role:

*None yet - project is young!*

## Decision Making

### Consensus Model

We use **lazy consensus** for most decisions:
1. Proposal posted (issue, PR, discussion)
2. Minimum 72-hour review period
3. Silence = consent
4. Any maintainer can block with veto (rare)

### Voting

For major decisions (architecture changes, license, governance):
- Supermajority required (2/3 of active maintainers)
- Minimum 1-week discussion period
- Vote recorded in issue/discussion

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions, ideas
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions
- **Email**: maintainers@hyperpolymath.org (private, security)
- **Matrix**: #economic-toolkit:matrix.org (planned)

## Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise:
1. Direct discussion between parties
2. Mediation by neutral maintainer
3. Escalation to all maintainers
4. Final decision by lead maintainer (rare)

## Code of Conduct Enforcement

Maintainers enforce our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md):
- Reports to conduct@hyperpolymath.org
- Investigated promptly (48-hour acknowledgment)
- Appropriate action taken per CoC guidelines

## Maintainer Rotation

To prevent burnout and encourage fresh perspectives:
- Maintainers may step down anytime (no penalty)
- Emeritus status preserves contributions
- New maintainers onboarded regularly

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to all maintainers, past and present, for your dedication!
