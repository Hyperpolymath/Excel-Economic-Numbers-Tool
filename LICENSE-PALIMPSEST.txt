## Palimpsest License Philosophy

Named after ancient manuscripts that were scraped clean and reused, the
Palimpsest License embodies the idea that software builds upon prior work,
layer by layer, creating a rich history of innovation.

Key principles:
- **Attribution over restriction**: Credit creators, but don't block progress
- **Voluntary copyleft**: Choose to perpetuate freedom, don't force it
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand, easy to comply with
- **Compatibility**: Works alongside other open source licenses

## Why "Palimpsest"?

In medieval times, parchment was expensive. Scribes would scrape off old text
and write new content on the same parchment, creating a "palimpsest." Modern
analysis can reveal the hidden layers beneath.

Similarly, software is built in layers:
- Original code (first layer)
- Modifications (second layer)
- Further derivatives (third layer)
- And so on...

Each layer acknowledges what came before while adding new value.

## Dual Licensing

This Software is dual-licensed under:
- MIT License (permissive, no attribution required for use)
- Palimpsest License v0.8 (attribution required for derivatives)

You may choose which license to follow. If distributing derivatives, Palimpsest
requires attribution; MIT does not.
